# Introduction

Welcome to the BD Lease API! You can use our API to publish, manage and remove resources to our database of cars and advertisers.

Before you can start using our API, please request a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` for your application.

# API Version

Our API consists of a staging environment to test your integration with our API and a production environment for exchanging live data. Both environments come with their own authentication tokens.

  - **Production** - https://bdlease.dev/
  - **Staging environment** - https://ptchr-bdlease-hexon.dev

The current version of our API is version 1.0, please prefix all routes using `api/v1/`, for example `https://bdlease.dev/api/v1/user`.
